# HDT-Battlegrounds helper
 HelloðŸ˜€ I'm a Novice developer as student.
 
This plugin is a overlay that small addition to [Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) on Battlegrounds mode. 

I would like to help who play Battlegrounds mode. But I don't have enough knowledge about c# and .NET Framework. So I got lots of help from [HDT Basic Plugin tutorial](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker/wiki/Basic-plugin-creation-tutorial) and other developers on discord Channel. I am so much obliged to all for your kindness.
